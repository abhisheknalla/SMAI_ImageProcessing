In this Project, the concepts of Principal Component Analysis,
Naive Bayes and Classification with Gradient Descent will be put to
application. I have used a small dataset containing some face
images of some people. Firstly, I performed principal component
analysis of all images combined. That will be used to get a small
number of principal eigen vectors to convert each image to a reduced
vector. Then I learnt a classifier using naive bayes method, a
linear classifier using gradient descent. I added
a report pdf in this project and used Python2 for this project.

### Dataset
- You are provided a subset of original dataset with labels. `<a>_<b>.jpg`
  image is bth image of ath class.
- You will use just images for Part-1 and prepare your report.
- For Part-2 and Part-3, you can use images and labels while developing code.

### Part-1 : Principal Component Analysis

- Perform PCA over all images. Get the co-efficients of all components for
  all images.

- We can reconstruct the image back using a small number of components.
  Plot a graph showing the total mean square error over all train images
  vs the number of principal components used to reconstruct.

- Decide $N$, the number of principal components required such that the
  reconstructed images will have mean squared error less than 20% over
  all train images. Display those $N$ principal components as
  reconstructed images.  You will see some base structures of the
  faces. Included these face images in the report.

- Use scatterplots to examine how the images are clustered in the 1D, 2D
  and 3D space using the required number of principal components.


### Part-2 : Naive Bayes Multi-class Classifier

  - Given train images-labels and test images.
  - Do PCA over train images and convert all images to a vector
    representation of length $N$ as per PCA. Use $N$ = 32.
  - Train a Naive bayes classifier using train images and then predict the
    labels of test images.
  - Code will run as : `python naive_bayes.py <path-to-train-file> <path-to-test-file>`
  - Structure of train and test file is explained later.

### Part-3 : Linear Multi-class Classifier

  - Given train images-labels and test images.
  - Do PCA over train images and convert all images to a vector
    representation of length $N$ as per PCA. Use $N$ = 32.
  - Train linear classifiers with gradient descent. You may want to use
    softmax to calculate loss.
  - For each test image, predict its label.
  - Code will run as `python linear_classifier.py <path-to-train-file> <path-to-test-file>`
  - Structure of train and test file is explained below. You can generate
    your own train and test file from given dataset.

  #### Structure of train file
  ```
  <absolute-path-to-train-1> <label-1>
  <absolute-path-to-train-2> <label-2>
  .
  .
  .
  <absolute-path-to-train-N> <label-N>
  ```

  #### Structure of test file
  ```
  <absolute-path-to-test-1>
  <absolute-path-to-test-2>
  .
  .
  .
  <absolute-path-to-test-M>
  ```

  #### Your output should be as follows:
  ```
  <test-label-1>
  <test-label-2>
  .
  .
  .
  <test-label-M>
  ```
